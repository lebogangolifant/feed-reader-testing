# Udacity-Feed-Reader-Testing                   

Front-End Web Nano Degree Scholarship project 4. Demonstrates browser based testing using Jasmin 2.1.2.

## Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Task

   - [x] Tests for allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
   - [x] Test loops through each feed in the allFeedsobject and ensuring if allFeeds have a url also that the url is not empty.
   - [x] Test loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
   - [x] Analyzing the HTML, CSS file to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
   - [x] Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
   - [x] Write a test that ensures when the loadFeedfunction is called and completes its work.
   - [x] Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeedfunction that the content actually changes. Tests to see if two entries are not equal.

   * When complete all tests should pass.
